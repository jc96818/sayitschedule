## When to use this

- You want to customize the app's appearance to match your organization's brand.
- You need to update your organization's name.
- You want to add or change your organization's logo.

## How it works

Organization branding settings let you personalize the app's appearance. Changes apply immediately and affect all users in your organization.

You can customize:

- **Organization Name**: Displayed in the app header and on printed schedules.
- **Primary Color**: Used for buttons, links, and accent elements.
- **Secondary Color**: Used for hover states and secondary UI elements.
- **Logo**: Displayed in the app header.

Colors are previewed in real-time as you adjust them, so you can see how they look before saving.

## Steps

### Update organization branding

1. Open **Settings** from the sidebar.
2. Find the **Organization Branding** card.
3. Update the **Organization Name** if needed.
4. Set your **Primary Color**:
   - Click the color picker to choose a color visually, or
   - Enter a hex code directly (e.g., `#2563eb`).
5. Set your **Secondary Color** using the same method.
6. Optionally, enter a **Logo URL**:
   - The logo should be hosted on a publicly accessible URL.
   - Recommended size: 80x80 pixels.
   - Supported formats: PNG, JPG, SVG.
7. Preview your logo in the preview area below the input.
8. Click **Save Changes**.

### Reset to original values

1. If you want to discard your changes, click **Reset**.
2. This restores the values to what they were when you opened the page.

## What each setting affects

| Setting | Where it appears |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| Organization Name | App header, printed schedules, patient portal (if enabled) |
| Primary Color | Buttons, links, active states, accent elements |
| Secondary Color | Hover effects, secondary buttons, subtle accents |
| Logo | App header (left side) |

## How this changes with your settings

- **Patient Portal**: If the patient portal is enabled and you haven't set separate portal colors, the portal will use your organization branding colors.
- **Printed schedules**: The organization name appears on printed schedule headers.

## Troubleshooting

- **Logo not appearing**: Ensure the URL is publicly accessible (not behind a login). Try opening the URL directly in a browser to verify it works.
- **Colors look different than expected**: Make sure you're entering valid hex codes starting with `#` (e.g., `#2563eb`). The color picker shows a preview—use it to verify your selection.
- **Changes not saving**: Ensure you click **Save Changes** after making edits. Check for any error messages that appear.
- **Reset button not working**: The reset button restores values to what they were when you opened the page, not the original defaults.
