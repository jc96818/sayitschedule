## Troubleshooting

- **Suggestions not appearing when adding {{labels.staff.plural}}**: Make sure you clicked **Save Label Settings** after adding suggestions.
- **Duplicate {{labels.certification.plural}}**: The system prevents adding duplicates. If you can't add a {{labels.certification.singular}}, it may already exist in the list.
- **{{labels.certification.singular}} removed from suggestions still on {{labels.staff.plural}}**: Removing a suggestion doesn't remove it from {{labels.staff.plural}} who already have it. You'd need to edit each {{labels.staff.singular}} individually.
