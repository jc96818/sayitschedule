## When to use this

- You searched for something in the Help Center but got "No results."
- You want to improve your search technique to find answers faster.
- You're not sure what terms to use when searching.

## How search works

The Help Center uses full-text search to find articles that match your query. The search looks at:

- Article titles and summaries
- Full article content
- Tags and keywords
- Common synonyms and aliases

Results are ranked by relevance, with the best matches appearing first.

## Best practices for searching

### Use simple, specific terms

Search for the main concept you need help with:

| Instead of | Try |
| ---------- | --- |
| "How do I add a new person to the schedule?" | "add staff" or "add patient" |
| "The schedule isn't working right" | "schedule errors" or "generate schedule" |
| "I can't figure out the rules" | "rules overview" or "create rule" |

### Try your organization's terms AND default terms

Your organization may use custom labels. If searching for your custom term doesn't work, try the default:

| Your term | Default term |
| --------- | ------------ |
| Therapists, Clinicians, Providers | Staff |
| Clients, Members, Residents | Patients |
| Offices, Studios, Bays | Rooms |
| Skills, Qualifications | Certifications |

### Search by page or feature name

If you need help with a specific page, search for its name:

- "Settings" - for configuration options
- "Rules" - for scheduling constraints
- "Schedule" - for viewing or generating schedules
- "Portal" - for patient portal features
- "Voice" - for voice command help

### Use category names

Browse by category if search doesn't find what you need:

- **Getting Started** - Overview and basics
- **People** - {{labels.staff.plural}} and {{labels.patient.plural}}
- **Rooms** - {{labels.room.plural}} and capabilities
- **Rules** - Scheduling constraints
- **Schedules** - Generating and viewing
- **Voice** - Voice commands
- **Settings** - Configuration
- **Portal** - Patient portal

## Common search issues

### "No results" message

If you see "No results," try:

1. **Use fewer words**: Search "staff" instead of "how to add staff members."
2. **Check spelling**: The search requires correct spelling.
3. **Try synonyms**: If "therapist" doesn't work, try "staff."
4. **Browse categories**: Click a category to see all available articles.

### Results don't match what you need

If search results aren't helpful:

1. **Be more specific**: Add a keyword like "add," "delete," "edit," or "view."
2. **Try the category**: Browse the relevant category to see all articles.
3. **Check related articles**: At the bottom of each article, find links to related topics.

### Can't find an article you saw before

Articles may be updated or reorganized. Try:

1. **Search by a unique word** you remember from the article.
2. **Browse the category** where you think it belongs.
3. **Check the glossary** for term definitions.
