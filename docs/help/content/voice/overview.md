## How it works

<!-- help:when features.voiceCommandsEnabled -->
Voice commands let you perform common actions without typing. The app will transcribe audio and interpret the request.
<!-- help:end -->

<!-- help:when-not features.voiceCommandsEnabled -->
Voice commands aren’t enabled for your organization. Ask an admin to enable them.
<!-- help:end -->
